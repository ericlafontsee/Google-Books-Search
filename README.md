# Google Book Search

## Description
For this project, I created an application using React that will allow the user to search Google books.   
Once the user has entered their search, the results will display and they will be presented with two options:   
1. To view the book on Google Books
2. To save the book to the database   

There is a separate saved page where the user can also view the book on Google or delete it from their saved  
page.

My application is deployed to Heroku:
